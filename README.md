# statistical_methods_for_data_science
Repository containing course material, assignments and final project of the course "Statistical Methods for Data Science" held by Professors Nicola Torelli, Leonardo Egidi, Gioia Di Credico at University of Trieste (a.y. 2020/2021).

The repository is organized as follows:

- `course_material` contains the material used during the classes (it is a bit untidy...sorry about that);

- `homework_1`, `homework_2`, `homework_3` contain the solutions of the assignments given during the course;
- `final_project` contains the final project to be presented at the exam.

*Note*: this was a team work.
